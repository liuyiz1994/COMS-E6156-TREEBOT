The rope_front_end is at (-1.25, 0.46, 0.16). I propose to PICK the rope_front_end. The path I plan is [(0.09, -0.07, 0.51), (-0.38, 0.13, 0.51), (-0.85, 0.30, 0.51), (-1.25, 0.46, 0.51)]. This path avoids the obstacle_wall_front_top and obstacle_wall_back_top, and it is evenly spaced. Bob, what's your plan?\n[Bob]:\nI am currently not holding anything and my gripper is at (0.05, 1.10, 0.62). The rope_back_end is at (-0.55, 0.31, 0.16). I propose to PICK the rope_back_end. The path I plan is [(0.05, 1.10, 0.62), (-0.16, 0.83, 0.62), (-0.37, 0.57, 0.62), (-0.55, 0.31, 0.62)]. This path avoids the obstacle_wall_front_top and obstacle_wall_back_top, and it is evenly spaced. Alice, does this plan work for you?\n[Alice]:\nYour plan works for me, Bob.

Bob, you might need to adjust your path to ensure it's feasible. I suggest you try to keep your gripper higher, maybe at around 0.7, before descending to pick up the rope_back_end. This should give you a more feasible path. Let's discuss this and come up with a new plan.\n[Bob]:\nI agree with your suggestion, Alice.
